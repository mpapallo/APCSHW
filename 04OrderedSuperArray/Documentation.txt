1. In order to check if my insertionSort() worked properly, I used a for loop to create a Super Array of the alphabet in reverse order.
Then I called insertionSort() on the Super Array and made sure the alphabet ended up in the correct order.

2. I compared the times of my insertionSort() and the badInsertionSort() in the terminal.
Using the reverse alphabet Super Array, the badInsertionSort() was recorded to be slower.
